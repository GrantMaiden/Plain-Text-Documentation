Prewriting

how did the name of turkey (the bird) become to be the same of an already existing country?

Turkey's are indigenous to the united states and Mexico.

Turkey (the bird) waas brought back to europe by Spanish Conquistadors around 1520. The bird was domesticated in England within a decade, and by the early 1600's it's name, "turkey", had been designated. (William Shakespeare used the term in one of his plays, Twelgth Night, written in 1601 or 1602)

turkey did not come straight to England from the Western hemisphere, rather, it was brought up from southern europe by merchnat ships in the mediterannian sea. These merchants were called "Turkey Merchants," because this area of europe was ruled byt the Turkish empire at the time.

Purchasers of the birds thought that they came from Turkey (the country), so they started to name them turkey's.

Turkey (land occupied by the turks) had similiar looking bird to North American Turkey, named the Guinea Fowl

Turkey the country name ( TÃ¼rkiye), can be broken up into two parts, "Turk", a reference to people, and iye, meaning, land of.

Other countries made similiar naming mistakes as England. An example is Isreal, were they believed that the birds were native to india, as they frequently purchased turkey from indian merchants. The work for turkey in hebrew is translated as "tarnagol hodu," which means chicken of india.
